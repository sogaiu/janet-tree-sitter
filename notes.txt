* janet wrapper of c
 * consider dynamic variable to hold current source, then have a
   node_text function?

* create README
  * prerequisites
    * janet / jpm
    * one or more relevant tree-sitter grammars installed
  * tests won't work without tree-sitter grammars for:
    * clojure
    * janet-simple
  * credits
    * bakpakin - pieces of janet, path.janet
    * pyrmont - discussion
    * Saikyun - discussion and text-experiment

* windows
  * see if it works there
  * is USER_PROFILE an appropriate place to look?

* wrap TSPoint?

* implement compare in abstract?

* possibly look at this stackoverflow post later:
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49322955/c-copy-struct-with-pointers-from-stack-to-heap/49323149
  it mentions TSNode
