* why is there a seg fault when exiting repl that uses this?
  * keep checking...once wrappers are removed, there's a chance
    this will be fixed.
  * use valgrind if problem surfaces again / try examining core files.
    * valgrind can be run on the generated test file (look for files
      beginning with an underscore)

* added a bunch of duplication of parser.c to tree_sitter.c to
  get dot_graph printing working (for the parser).  can this
  be avoided?  may be neovim code has hints.

* handling freeing of parser ok?

* is it a problem if:

  TSNode *parent_p =
    (TSNode *)janet_abstract(&jts_node_type, sizeof(TSNode));

  *parent_p = ts_node_parent(node);
  if (ts_node_is_null(*parent_p)) {
    return janet_wrap_nil();
  }

  return janet_wrap_abstract(parent_p);

  the nil return path is taken and the parent_p is never wrapped?

  is gc done correctly?

* nicer if cfun_parser_parse_string can handle buffers as input?

  may be the following could be adapted?

/* Get a c like string, but also works with buffers. */
static const char *jaylib_getcstring(const Janet *argv, int32_t n) {
    if (janet_checktype(argv[n], JANET_BUFFER)) {
        JanetBuffer *buf = janet_unwrap_buffer(argv[n]);
        janet_buffer_push_u8(buf, 0);
        buf->count--;
        return (const char *)buf->data;
    }
    return janet_getcstring(argv, n);
}

* figure out how to get debug output from parsing
  * --debug-graph
  * --debug
    * figure out how to make logging more generic

* understand the following warnings and implications:

* add test for print-s-expr comparing with result of tree-sitter parse result?
  clojure's core.clj might not be a bad thing to test against.

* should nil be returned from things like cfun_node_first_named_child_for_byte
  or cfun_node_first_child_for_byte or should a node which passes the ts_node_is_null
  test be returned instead?

* consider emulating portions of emacs' tree-sitter integration api, e.g.
  treesit-search-subtree

* lang-name-to-path has details about where tree-sitter looks for things baked
  in.  some of these may have changed in the 0.20.x series (e.g. ~/.tree-sitter
  may no longer be (the only place?) where things are searched?
  ~/.cache/tree-sitter/lib is (also?) searched...).  it may be that searching
  the tree-sitter repository for XDG might help in clarifying / determining
  details.

* figure out how to not depend on path.janet?

* valgrind
  * invocation command(s):
  valgrind --tool=memcheck --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes --dsymutil=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --show-error-list=yes janet usages/clojure.janet
  valgrind --tool=callgrind janet usages/clojure.janet

* consider dynamic variable to hold current source, then have a node_text
  function?

* wrap TSPoint?

* implement compare, tostring, etc. in abstract?

* possibly look at this stackoverflow post later:

  it mentions TSNode
